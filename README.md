# GraphClusterGenerator

This NetBeans project contains a random graph cluster generator, which can be used to produce nice-looking clusters. Basically, it produces groups of random “forests,” which are small, densely-connected graphs of 5-20 nodes. Then, a few sparse edges are inserted between the forests in order to finish it. Some examples of these graphs are included in the SAMPLES.pdf file.
